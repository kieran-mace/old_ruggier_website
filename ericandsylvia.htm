<p><IMG border="0" src="images/ericandsylvia2.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="213">Eric celebrated 
his 75th birthday on 8th January, 2007, and Sylvia her 72nd in August. Next 
August will be our golden wedding anniversary. Fifty happy years of married 
life! We thank God for all His blessings, and especially for 3 wonderful 
children and now all our lovely grandchildren - until a couple of months ago, 
five in number, and now suddenly seven! Yes - Michael and Orietta have finally 
given us two more! Andrea and Olivia arrived August 2007 from Archangel, Russia 
- two adorable children. </p>
<p>When we retired, exactly 10 years ago, at 65, and after working non-stop for 
49 years, we thought life would be quiet, restful, with plenty of spare time. In 
practice, it has been quite the opposite! But we are pleased it has been so. We 
are never bored! There is never a dull moment. We go to The Lensbury Club 3 
times a week for a swim, aquarobics, etc., and go dancing Argentine Tango 
whenever we can, voluntary work for local amenity groups, time with 
grandchildren if they ever need help with homework, etc. - so time goes by very 
quickly. </p>
<p>We are looking forward so much to the family Re-union in South Africa in 
December. It will be wonderful to meet up again with all the wide-spread family 
and all the new additions we have never met before. </p>
<p>Cheers. Eric and Sylvia</p>
