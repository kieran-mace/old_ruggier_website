<p>We have all had an excellent year – here’s the load down. </p>
<p>Firstly Kieran has now been attending Boston University for 1.5 years. He 
started there in August 2006 reading a Pre-Medical Degree. Romanie, another 
following your footsteps! Kieran has taken to university life like a duck to 
water and has thoroughly enjoyed his new life. Apart from parties, and the like, 
Kieran spent most of his time rowing. BU has an awesome freshmen team. In the 
“Four” he came 3rd in the IRA’s [largest university competition with 300 entries]! 
Superb achievement. Kieran is into his second year and going for it! </p>
<p>Connor is currently writing his finals. He is so excited to be finished with 
school forever – only a few weeks away. Over the last couple of years, Connor 
has had some superb experiences. Rowing has also dominated his life. He won the 
SA Champs 2005 [after having won in the Pair with Kieran in 2004] and this time 
got invited to compete at the World Championships in Amsterdam 2006. What work 
and dedication it took to get there, but he did it. We all went to watch, 
including Melissa [his Godmother] and had a fantastic time. Connor came 15th out 
of 40 countries. He intends to also study in the US if they will have him! In 
the meantime he is heading north for the ski slopes and some work. Good luck in 
your travels. </p>
<p>After Amsterdam Kieran, Connor and myself joined some friends on a barge in 
France. Had a really superb trip along the canals – really relaxing and cool 
holiday. </p>
<p>Michele is well and alive and living in Johannesburg [which I just love by 
the way]! I have started painting which is such fun and therapeutic. I am no 
expert, but just adore it. Am learning more and more as the months go by. My 
latest love is the stock market. Spend loads of time discovering this delicate 
and fascinating world – and intend to make it my ‘retirement’ pastime. Next year 
will be really different – no kids around. Don’t know what I will get up to? But 
will be something wild I can assure you. Cant believe I have both my kids out of 
school already! Certainly don’t feel that old!!</p>
