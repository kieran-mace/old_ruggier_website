    <H2>About Us </H2>
    <DIV class="content">
    <p>We’ve travelled on and off since getting married in 1993, and come to rest 
    in Poole, Dorset. After an eighteen-month yee-har in Texas, we headed for 
    Connecticut, where Jake was born in 1995. A change of jobs for Paul saw us 
    back in the UK, and we spent seven years near Kew Gardens in Surrey, where 
    we were joined by Dylan in 1997 and Abigail in 2000.</p>
    <p>When Abigail was two, Paul rang home one day and said ‘How about Paris 
    for a couple of years?’ We didn’t have to think for long, and a month later 
    we were installed in a beautiful house in Le Mesnil le Roi, just west of 
    Paris, with gorgeous views across the lawns to the Eiffel Tower and La 
    Defense. Paul set about establishing a Paris office for his company. The 
    children went to a French International school, where life was hard, but 
    sociable. Nicky learned a lot of French, talking to French utilities and 
    appliance repair people! We all made some life-long friends who we continue 
    to see as often as we can. </p>
    <p>When the call came that the French sojourn was over after two and a half 
    years, we decided overcrowded London was no longer for us. As Paul has to 
    travel so much anyhow, we felt we could, and should just choose a nice place 
    to live. So we headed for Poole, Nicky’s home town, and in the space of four 
    days found a house and some lovely schools for the children. The move took 
    place in August 2005. We enjoy living close to the shores of Poole Harbour, 
    so with the beach fifteen minutes walk away, and the yacht club down the 
    road, life really is a holiday - we think we’ll stay here!</p>
