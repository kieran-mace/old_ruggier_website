<H1>Gabrielle, Murray and Mia Bolton</H1>

<P><img border="0" src="images/G&M_3.jpg" align="left" width="350" height="263"></P>

<p>What's new in the last five years is that I met Murray, married Murray, moved 
to Joburg, bought a townhouse, changed jobs, had a baby, joined the roaring 40's 
and have become someone who thinks the idea of a few more hours of sleep is far 
more exciting than going out anywhere! </p>
<p>Met Murray on a beach in a bikini in December (the same year that the 
Ruggier’s came to Cape Town for a holiday) and dazzled him with my beach bat 
skills. He was the only person I wanted to see when I went up to Joburg shortly 
thereafter to visit The Westcliff hotel, The Mount Nelson's sister hotel ......
</p>
<p>We married two and a half years later on 30 July 2005 and had the most 
memorable reception on a beautiful sunny warm winters' day at Harbour House 
restaurant, right on the seashore, in Kalk Bay, Cape Town (lots and lots of 
photos on our photo gallery). </p>
<p>Two years later on 11 April 2007 baby Mia Isabella Bolton was born (again, 
lots of photos on our photo gallery). The most beautiful healthy very little 
2,4kg baby who screamed through most of her first three months of life (and 
which I only survived through the calm patience of my husband and a fabulous 
intervention by my parents when my Mom flew up to Joburg to come and fetch me 
and bring me and Mia back to their house (my old home) where we stayed for much 
longer than originally intended! And now, at seven and a half months, Mia is a 
gummily smiling, messily eating, insatiably curious little bundle of joy and 
love. </p>
