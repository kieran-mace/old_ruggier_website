<P>My little ones, </P>
<P>I am lying in a hospital bed a few days after having lost you. It feels like 
eons away, like part of a past life, but I suppose that is exactly what it was. 
There is so much pain in my heart right now and my belly is empty. I miss you. I 
miss the way my belly felt, I miss looking at your antics during the scans, I 
miss those hours spent daydreaming about the way the nursery would look like 
once you had arrived. I miss not being able to show off my belly. I regret I 
never felt you move about or kick inside of me. </P>
<P>And I remember. I remember the joy of seeing the pee stick turn pink, the 
elation of that first HSCG results and the second one on the lawn of Don Campo’s 
runway. I remember the wonder of hearing Baby A’s heartbeat for the first time, 
the way it took my breath away, the darkness in the room, the gasp of wonder 
coming from Michael. I remember hearing your little heartbeats together for the 
first time, the way it sounded like little feet running around the floorboards 
of our Aberdeen home, something I was sure I was going to see and hear for real 
one day. I remember driving away with Michael that day and the way we chattered 
excitedly and thought our hearts would burst with happiness. I remember the 
weekly appointments at the scan where we would get to see and hear you again, 
the way Michael thought we chart your growth and heart beats, how it amused Dr 
Hickman. I remember the peace and serenity which seemed to envelop me as I took 
it one week at a time. And the way your 12th week fell on Thanksgiving Day. We 
thought we were home and dry then! </P>
<P>I remember that wondrous first scan at Dr Adam’s, even though it will always 
pain me to think Michael missed it, especially now you are gone. You had grown 
so big! You had changed from kidney beans to real little human beings. I 
remember Baby B’s feet popping onto the screen; two perfect little soles with 
perfect little toes (little did I know then how large those feet would grow!). 
And Baby A lying there, looking ever so comfortable cradled in the curve of my 
uterus. And Baby C’s little hand waving around as though she was saying hello.
</P>
<P>I remember how it felt every time I said to anyone “I am pregnant”, that 
feeling of pride and warmth. And I remember Michael’s happiness, his hand on my 
belly, the way his voice would soften every time he talked to you, the way he 
would show you off to the world, his pride, his plans, his dreams. For you he 
was going to give up his restlessness, his need to roam the world, his nights 
out. But not his sunbathing! </P>
<P>And then our dream began to shatter just like a windscreen hit by a pebble 
where all you can see is an indentation and tiny little cracks forming. Cracks 
which through the days will grow, eventually out of control until the whole 
thing is shattered. That first scan, just a routine one, where Baby A’s waters 
had broken. The entry into the hospital for what we thought was going to be a 
long stay. Christmas spent praying for Baby A in the safe knowledge Baby B and 
Baby C would be OK. And then Baby A’s heartbeat stopped and I gave birth to it. 
That long arm with the perfect little hand, the body still enveloped in its 
membrane. And the day later, New Year’s Day, the rock truly hits the windscreen. 
Baby C is dead; she had actually stopped growing at week 15. And Baby B has lost 
its waters. </P>
<P>Baby B, our little one who came out of nowhere to surprise us. You were only 
given a 60% chance of developing further than week 7 and still you grew, little 
tenacious boy, not prepared to give up and disappear. The last one left, your 
little heart still beating but hope of your making it to term and surviving 
slowly ebbing away as your waters disappeared. That night I prayed to God “If 
you will not let me have a healthy baby please end it now”. And so it was. You 
were born with your little sister in the early hours if January 3rd. Dr Adam 
cleaned you up and gave you to us to hold and love for a few minutes longer. You 
gave us our most cherished and lasting memory, the picture of what all of you 
had grown into, a tangent real baby to see, wander at and hold. You were perfect 
even if ever so tiny, small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. Michael’s nose 
and chin, you would have looked just like him. And my feet. </P>
<P>Now you are all gone. We miss you, in the dreams and plans which will not 
come true, and in the little things of everyday. I am slowly building a special 
place in my heart filled with bittersweet memories and lined with love where you 
can share the rest of my life with me. I know in my heart that there will be 
other babies and that these will make it and fill our lives with love, laughter 
and trouble. But you will always have a special place in my heart. </P>
<P>I love you </P>
<P>Mummy </P>
