<p>We moved to Brisbane in June 2003 when a position became available. We live 
in a lovely part of the world on the Bay. Our house is on a canal that leads 
directly into the bay. We are enjoying living on the coast after all those years 
in Jo'burg. Taking our boat to some of the nearby islands is a real treat and 
something that we never get tired of. There are a few fantastic islands a short 
ferry ride from Brisbane where we go camping from time to time. </p>
<p>It's a great place for a holiday and we'd love to see you in our part of the 
world. </p>
<h2>Shannon </h2>
<p>Shannon loves reading, art and creative playing. Her favourite sport is 
netball and recently has started Nippers (Junior lifesaving), a good excuse to 
spend the day on the beach. She also plays the keyboard and does ballet. She 
loves organising home plays and dress ups. She has a lovely sense of humour and 
is quite used to getting teased by Dad. Most of all she loves to make mess, 
painting, eating, whatever! </p>
<h2>Robbie </h2>
<p>Robbie loves making things. Either his Lego or Knex but especially from 
boxes, plastic bottles, etc. He has a collection in his room. Robbie's favourite 
sport is soccer and is also doing Nippers (junior lifesaving). He loves taking 
his bike to the bike ramp. He is a kind, happy kid but like any brother takes 
some delight in winding up his sisters every now and then. </p>
<h2>Theresa </h2>
<p>Theresa enjoys ballet and gymnastics and will probably join Shannon and 
Robbie at Nippers soon. She starts year 1 next year (2008). She enjoys drawing 
and reading her books. She loves the privileges of being baby of the family but 
is growing up too fast!</p>
