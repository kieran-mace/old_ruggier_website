<H1>Lisa, Paul, James and Blake Taylor</H1>

<P><img border="0" src="images/Lisa&Paul.jpg" align="left" width="350" height="278">The Taylors are all 
very well and life in Plett continues to be peachy. Paul continues with 
Cornerstone Ceilings. He has a good amount of work and the 2nd half of the year 
looks hectic. So thank The Lord, he is busy and well. Since the split with his 
partner last October and moving his office to home, I must say I have a brand 
new happy husband. You know the old one that I married. He has time for the kids 
which he absolutely loves. We all have lunch together every day and dinner too. 
Our family life is of paramount importance to him. We have sold our house and 
move in February 2008. We’re all very sad as we love our beautiful place. But 
Paul will be building us another one next year and we are very excited about 
that. The kids are great. James is growing taller each day. He loves school and 
is looking forward to “big” school next year. He has become a fast runner and 
has to shoot everywhere like a rocket. He also has a huge appreciation for 
music. Even in our church which is rather loud and partyish, I have to find ways 
to restrain him from dancing the building down. He is also learning to 
appreciate the marine life here. Last week we were on the beach at the end of 
the day when this school of dolphin arrived to surf the waves right in front of 
us. They were in a playful mood and did a few flips for us. When that stopped we 
decided to stand really close to the water (the dolphins couldn’t have been more 
that 10m away) and we tried to ask them to do more for us. James was squeaking 
and Blake was blaaa…ing with hands cupped to his face. The next thing, they 
started again. Jumping and summer-saulting. It was the most rewarding few 
minutes. James says to me “Mommy, I didn’t know I could speak Dolphin!” He has 
joined “Nippers” (junior Life Saving) and is having a blast. Paul, Blake and I 
also have a good time watching him on Friday afternoons which leads onto a time 
of socializing with others over a few drinks and a braai. Blake is growing fast 
and has absolutely NO fear. I call him my thumper. He jumps off couches and 
walls as if he’s going onto a trampoline. He is a very happy child and is 
forever smiling. He has just started to say Mama, and Dada. The name James is a 
bit hard for him, so “Das” has to suffice. As for me, my life is good. My work 
is fabulous. I love selling property. I have been alone in my office for nearly 
2 years now and finally have found someone to join me. Lanice started with me in 
August. It is going so well. We even open in prayer in the mornings. Our plan is 
to take this small agency to another level in the not too distant future.</P>
