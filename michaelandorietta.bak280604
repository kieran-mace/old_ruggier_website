<H1>Michael and Orietta Ruggier</H1>

<P>
<IMG border="0" src="images/Michaelandorietta.jpg" align="left" width="248" height="261" hspace="15" vspace="8"><P>&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;<P>Well, guys and girls, the last time we had a 
    chance to see a large contingent of the Ruggier clan was at our wedding, and 
    that was 3½ years ago. We still have the fondest memories of that day and 
    the party the day before when Claire, Natasha and Michelle managed to 
    surprise Hilda and Norman to such good effect. We really cannot express our 
    joy at having so many of the ‘clan’ there to share such a special day with 
    us!<P>&nbsp;<P>When we first met we shared our dreams and aspirations. One of those 
    shared dreams was to travel and see the world…….. Well, since our wedding we 
    have lived in three different continents! This is actually our fourth house 
    in as many years, although surrounded as we are by memories purchased during 
    our travels it feels as much of a home as in the previous ones. It is a 
    delightful apartment in Houston complete with pool and BBQ pit (of course!) 
    and we are right in the middle of the ‘action’, which over here means lots 
    of restaurants……<TABLE border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">

<P>As you all know by now September this year brought us our most cherished 
blessing. After three long years of struggling with infertility we finally got 
pregnant. Now let it not be said that Michael will ever do things by half….. so 
why should this be any different? It transpires we are having triplets which to 
us in a never ending source of delight and merriment!!!! </P>
<P>The babies are due on June 11th but are expected to come in early May, so we 
are packing in our last travels for a while. Orietta’s father and step mum came 
to Houston in November and we underwent a fabulous trip to Santa Fe, the canyons 
of Utah, Las Vegas, Sedona and Tucson. We saw beautiful natural phenomena (and I 
am not talking of Michael here!) and followed suit by plunging ourselves in the 
decadence of Las Vegas! </P>

flirt with fame before the little ones started to show…..</P>

<P>There followed a cruise to Mexico where Orietta spent most of her time eating 
and managed to gain 4lb in a long weekend…… all for the sake of the little ones 
of course!!!! For Christmas we are off to Costa Rica for two weeks of sea, sun 
and volcanoes, after which Orietta will be ‘grounded’ but Michael is allowed to 
go skiing. </P>
<P>Christmas really has got us by surprise this year. The weather here in 
Houston is still warm and we tend to keep away from the commerciality of the 
shopping centres, as a result of which we have done no shopping, no card sending 
and no home decorating! Actually is has been extremely liberating being so 
disorganized. </P>
<P>We really would like to thank Paul &amp; Nicky here for their fabulous Christmas 
present to us all. We know from experience how much time and care it takes to 
put something like this together and are excited and grateful of the way it will 
make it SO much easier to keep in touch. One of the great downsides of being so 
far away from the clan is the fact that we miss seeing the little ones growing 
up and this will go some way to make up for it. Our hearts, thoughts and prayers 
are with you all this Christmas. We wish you happiness, health and prosperity 
for the new year…………… and keep the news coming!!!!!! </P>
