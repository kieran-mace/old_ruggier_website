<p>The past while has been quite the adventure for the gypsy McNallys. Matthew 
and Bridget were born in Toronto and have been loyal to the land of the great 
white north singing their “O Canada” at every passport control they pass through, 
however after braving -25 degrees centigrade for long enough, we departed 
Toronto for warmer climes and headed for the island of Providenciales in the 
Turks and Caicos Islands. M and B attended Provo Primary while Kim and Luke made 
a living while running their internet based business from the deck of our home. 
There was to odd conference call that was made from the beach – but please don’t 
tell! </p>
<p>As with all good things they will come to an end (until you can focus on the 
next thing), and with the Island experiencing significant growth the 
communications network began to creek – in true Caribbean style, while we were 
crying for more uptime and internet connectivity, the official response was an 
emphatic “yeah mon”!! Having found one adventure fun, we decided to let it all 
hang out and winged our way to Thailand. After scoping out Phuket – and not 
loving it, we headed north to Chiang Mai and the wonders of Prem School. This 
short sojourn was an awesome experience for both parents and kids. At one point 
when checking in with Matthew on how he was feeling about all the moving this 
was the reply “well in the last week I’ve shaken a monkey’s hand, felt an 
elephant’s trunk and kissed a python . . . . . I think I’m OK!” </p>
<p>Being back in SA for the past year has been fantastic – particularly as both 
sides of our family have been through some hectic health challenges. L and K 
continue to run their business and now also have a South African company 
dedicated to this market, and M and B are in a farm school in the Natal 
midlands. Bridgie loves her horse riding while Matthew is fast becoming a 
football legend &#61514; On entering the school ground one is welcomed by a large sign 
reading “Drive Carefully, Free Range Children” – and if the mud the kids bring 
home is any measure of “free ranging” then the school really means it.</p>
