<p>Liam was born in 2004 and turning into an extremely adventurous, confident 
and happy little boy. He loves being outside doing physical activities, 
particularly anything to do with building. If you ask him what he is going to be 
when he is older he will tell you a builder. He is also an avid Springbok 
supporter and loves to tell everyone how the Springboks kicked the Lions butt (Sorry 
UK cousins!!). </p>
<p>Jan is extremely busy at work but enjoying it and the company is doing well 
so we can’t complain. After quite an absence from sailing his is once again 
quite involved and loving it. </p>
<p>I resigned from full-time employ at the end of last year and have 
subsequently got involved doing free-lance work for a company I worked for 10 
years ago. It offers mentally challenging work with great flexibility in terms 
of hours. I love being able to do some work and be able to spend quality time 
with Liam.</p>
